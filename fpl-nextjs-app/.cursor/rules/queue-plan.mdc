# BullMQ Queue Service Implementation Plan

Here's a high-level implementation plan for adding a BullMQ service to handle your cron job queue:

## 1. Setup Basic Queue Structure ✅
Create a new directory queue-service at the root level
Initialize basic Node.js project with TypeScript
Add BullMQ and Redis dependencies
Create directory structure for queues, workers, and utilities

## 2. Define Queue Configuration ✅
Create queue definitions for each cron job type
Implement connection settings for Redis
Build configuration layer for environment variables

## 3. Develop Core Worker Logic ✅
Implement worker classes for each job type
Add error handling and retry mechanisms
Create processor functions for job execution

## 4. Build Queue API Layer ✅
Develop REST endpoints to add/remove/monitor jobs
Implement authentication for secure access
Create job scheduling utilities

## 5. Create Admin Dashboard ✅
Implement a simple monitoring UI (optional)
Add job management capabilities
Display queue metrics and job statuses

## 6. Integration with Existing Cron Services
Refactor existing cron services to use queue
Update API endpoints to work with BullMQ
Maintain backward compatibility

## 7. Deployment Configuration
Create Railway service
Configure environment variables for production

## 8. Testing and Monitoring
Add health checks for the queue service
Implement logging and monitoring
Create test scripts for queue functionality

## 9. Documentation
Update README with queue service details
Document API endpoints and job types
Provide setup instructions for local development

## 10. Migration Plan
Create strategy for migrating from direct cron to queue system
Implement new queue system
