# Testing the Conversation Accumulation Fix

## Changes Made

1. **Modified System Prompt**: Added critical instruction to only respond to the most recent question
2. **Limited Context Window**: Restricted context messages to last 10 messages to prevent overwhelming the model

## Test Plan

### Test 1: Basic Question Isolation
1. Start a new conversation
2. Ask: "Who is the top scorer?"
3. **Expected**: Response ONLY about top scorer
4. Ask: "How is Arsenal doing?"
5. **Expected**: Response ONLY about Arsenal (no mention of top scorer)
6. Ask: "Arsenal vs Liverpool?"
7. **Expected**: Response ONLY comparing the teams (no mention of previous questions)

### Test 2: Context Awareness
1. Ask: "Tell me about Salah"
2. **Expected**: Response about Salah
3. Ask: "What about his FPL performance?"
4. **Expected**: Response about Salah's FPL stats (using context that "his" refers to Salah)
5. Ask: "Is he worth buying?"
6. **Expected**: FPL recommendation about Salah (not re-explaining who Salah is)

### Test 3: Explicit Reference
1. Ask: "Who scored the most goals?"
2. **Expected**: Response about top scorer
3. Ask: "And who has the most assists?"
4. **Expected**: Response ONLY about assists leader
5. Ask: "Tell me about both the top scorer and assist leader"
6. **Expected**: Response covering both (explicit request to revisit previous info)

### Test 4: Tool Usage Efficiency
1. Ask: "Show me league leaders"
2. **Expected**: Uses league leaders tool once
3. Ask: "What about Manchester United players?"
4. **Expected**: Uses player search tool (not league leaders again)
5. Ask: "Compare their top players"
6. **Expected**: May reference previous data or make new calls as needed

## Success Criteria

✓ Each response addresses ONLY the current question
✓ Context is used for understanding pronouns and references
✓ Previous information is not repeated unless explicitly requested
✓ Tool usage is efficient and targeted
✓ Conversation feels natural and focused

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Increase context window limit if losing important context
2. Adjust prompt wording if misunderstanding instruction
3. Consider alternative approaches from CONVERSATION_ACCUMULATION_BUG.md
