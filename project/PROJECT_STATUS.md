- [x] Basic search tools
- [x] Clear data separation
- [x] Text-only responses

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI & Data Visualization (Next)
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
- [ ] Tables for player/team comparisons
- [ ] Charts for form/performance trends
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Loading states and progress indicators
- [ ] Rich formatting for responses
- [ ] Export data functionality (CSV/JSON)

### Phase 3: FPL Features & User Authentication
**Timeline: 4-6 weeks**
- [ ] User authentication (OAuth/Supabase)
- [ ] Connect to user's FPL account (read-only access)
- [ ] Team management features (view-only)
- [ ] Transfer recommendations (advisory only)
- [ ] Captain/vice-captain suggestions (advisory only)
- [ ] Mini-league tracking (read-only)
- [ ] Price change predictions
- [ ] Wildcard/chips optimization (advisory strategies)
- [ ] *Note: All team management features will be advisory only due to FPL API limitations*

### Phase 4: Predictive Analytics & ML
**Timeline: 6-8 weeks**
- [ ] Performance prediction models
- [ ] Injury risk assessment
- [ ] Form trend analysis
- [ ] Optimal team selection AI
- [ ] Price change predictions
- [ ] Expected points modeling
- [ ] Fixture difficulty analysis
- [ ] Player comparison ML

## 📊 Success Metrics

### MVP Success ✅
- [x] Correctly identifies top scorers (real goals)
- [x] Distinguishes FPL points from real stats
- [x] Handles player name variations
- [x] Provides clear error messages
- [x] Responds within 2 seconds

### Production Targets
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] <1s average response time
- [ ] 10,000 daily active users
- [ ] 95% query success rate
- [ ] 4.5+ star user rating

## 🐛 Known Issues & Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. No automatic data updates (relies on cache expiration)
2. Text-only responses
3. Limited to English language
4. No user personalization
5. Basic error recovery

### Planned Improvements
1. Add scheduled cron jobs for data updates
2. Implement data visualization
3. Add multi-language support
4. Create user preference system
5. Enhanced error handling with fallbacks

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### To Address
1. Add comprehensive test suite
2. Implement monitoring/alerting
3. Add request/response logging
4. Create admin dashboard
5. Optimize database queries
6. Reimplement Redis caching layer

### Data Architecture Decisions

We've determined that the FPL API will serve as the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for Phases 1 and 2, with Redis caching to provide performance benefits:

1. **Current Approach**: FPL API + Redis caching
   - All current tools use read-only data from the FPL API
   - Redis caching provides sufficient performance optimization
   - Simpler architecture with fewer systems to maintain
   - No data synchronization issues to manage

2. **Database Introduction Timeline**:
   - No database needed until Phase 3 (FPL Features & User Authentication)
   - Database will be introduced specifically for:
     - User authentication and profiles
     - User-specific preferences and settings
     - Persistent storage of user-generated content
     - Historical data tracking beyond API capabilities
   - **Important API Limitation**: The official FPL API is read-only and does not support write operations (transfers, team management, etc.). Phase 3 features will require:
     - User authentication with the official FPL website
     - Browser automation or unofficial methods for team management actions
     - Secure credential storage in database

3. **Redis Cache Strategy**:
   - Dynamic TTL: 15-minute cache during live matches, 1-hour cache otherwise
   - Proactive cache warming for frequently accessed data
   - Automatic invalidation for data updates
   - Monitoring for cache hit/miss rates

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This Week)
   - [ ] Deploy MVP to Railway
   - [ ] Monitor performance metrics
   - [ ] Gather user feedback
   - [ ] Fix any critical bugs

2. **Short Term** (Next 2 Weeks)
   - [ ] Start Phase 2 (UI enhancements)
   - [ ] Add basic analytics
   - [ ] Improve error messages
   - [ ] Reimplement and optimize Redis caching layer

3. **Medium Term** (Next Month)
   - [ ] Complete Phase 2
   - [ ] Start Phase 3 planning
   - [ ] User research for FPL features
   - [ ] Performance optimization

4. **Long Term** (3+ Months)
   - [ ] Launch FPL features
   - [ ] Begin ML development
   - [ ] Plan multi-league architecture
   - [ ] Scale infrastructure
