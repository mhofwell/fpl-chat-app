## 📊 Success Metrics

### MVP Success ✅
- [x] Correctly identifies top scorers (real goals)
- [x] Distinguishes FPL points from real stats
- [x] Handles player name variations
- [x] Provides clear error messages
- [x] Responds within 2 seconds

### Production Targets
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] <1s average response time
- [ ] 10,000 daily active users
- [ ] 95% query success rate
- [ ] 4.5+ star user rating

## 🐛 Known Issues & Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. No automatic data updates (relies on cache expiration)
2. Text-only responses
3. Limited to English language
4. No user personalization
5. Basic error recovery

### Planned Improvements
1. Add scheduled cron jobs for data updates
2. Implement data visualization
3. Add multi-language support
4. Create user preference system
5. Enhanced error handling with fallbacks

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### To Address
1. Add comprehensive test suite
2. Implement monitoring/alerting
3. Add request/response logging
4. Create admin dashboard
5. Optimize database queries
6. Add caching layers
